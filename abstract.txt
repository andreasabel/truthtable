Intuitionistic truth table natural deduction (ITTND), which is
inherently non-confluent, has been shown strongly normalizing (SN)
using continuation-passing-style translations to parallel lambda
calculus.  We investigate the applicability of standard
model-theoretic proof techniques and show (1) SN of detour reduction
(β) using Girard's reducibility candidates, repairing a previous proof
attempt, and (2) SN of detour and permutation reduction (βπ) using
biorthogonals.
