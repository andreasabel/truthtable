\newcommand{\ABSTRACT}{
  This document provides a formal proof of strong normalization for
  combinatory algebra with the two combinators S and K and a term
  former for non-deterministic choice.  The result
  follows from a model construction where each type is interpreted as a
  reducibility candidate Ã  la Girard.  We thus demonstrate in the most
  simple setting that Girard's
  method works for non-confluend calculi.  In particular, since combinatory
  algebra is a variable-free language, we forgo the need to define
  substitution.  The proof has been formalized in Agda~2.6.2 and this
  document reproduces the commented Agda code.
