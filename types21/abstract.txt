Intuitionistic truth table natural deduction (ITTND), which is
inherently non-confluent, has been shown strongly normalizing (SN)
using continuation-passing-style translations to parallel lambda
calculus.  We investigate the applicability of standard
model-theoretic proof techniques and show SN of detour and permutation
reduction (βπ) using (1) biorthogonals and (2) saturated sets.
